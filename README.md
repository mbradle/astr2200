# Astronomy 2200 notebooks

These notebooks relate to the course Astronomy 2200, including solving problems in the textbook [Fundamental Planetary Science](https://www.amazon.com/Fundamental-Planetary-Science-Updated-Habitability/dp/1108411983/ref=sr_1_2?crid=2MCEZDODJZBH7&dchild=1&keywords=fundamental+planetary+science&qid=1629900721&sprefix=fundamental+pla%2Caps%2C147&sr=8-2).  Download the notebook onto your computer and run with [Jupyter technology](https://jupyter.org) or click on the Open in Colab badge to run on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb?utm_source=scs-index).
